                <p>AttackOnCode was created in 2022 by <strong> Muhammad Maaz Ahmed</strong>. The whole purpose of this website is, to provide newbie developers a free will to ask
questions related to programming and their coding issues. There are many websites on the internet available for developers to ask
questions but I felt that there is a need for a new platform for newbie developers where they can ask questions freely without the fear
of being downvoted. Every programming related question is appreciated here, but be careful not to violate any of the <a href="terms-conditions.php" class="tc">terms and conditions</a>. Enjoy and Attack each other with your queries!</p>
